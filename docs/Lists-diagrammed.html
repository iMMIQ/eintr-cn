<p>For example, the list <code class="code">(rose violet buttercup)</code> has three
elements, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">rose</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">violet</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">buttercup</samp>&rsquo;.  In the
computer, the electronic address of &lsquo;<samp class="samp">rose</samp>&rsquo; is recorded in a
segment of computer memory called a <em class="dfn">cons cell</em> (because it&rsquo;s what
the function <code class="code">cons</code> actually creates).  That cons cell also holds
the address of a second cons cell, whose <small class="sc">CAR</small> is the atom
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">violet</samp>&rsquo;; and that address (the one that tells where to find
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">violet</samp>&rsquo;) is kept along with the address of a third cons cell
which holds the address for the atom &lsquo;<samp class="samp">buttercup</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>This sounds more complicated than it is and is easier seen in a diagram:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">    ___ ___      ___ ___      ___ ___
   |___|___|--&gt; |___|___|--&gt; |___|___|--&gt; nil
     |            |            |
     |            |            |
      --&gt; rose     --&gt; violet   --&gt; buttercup
</pre></div></div>
<br>
<br>

<p>In the diagram, each box represents a word of computer memory that
holds a Lisp object, usually in the form of a memory address.  The boxes,
i.e., the addresses, are in pairs.  Each arrow points to what the address
is the address of, either an atom or another pair of addresses.  The
first box is the electronic address of &lsquo;<samp class="samp">rose</samp>&rsquo; and the arrow points
to &lsquo;<samp class="samp">rose</samp>&rsquo;; the second box is the address of the next pair of boxes,
the first part of which is the address of &lsquo;<samp class="samp">violet</samp>&rsquo; and the second
part of which is the address of the next pair.  The very last box
points to the symbol <code class="code">nil</code>, which marks the end of the list.
</p>
<p>When a variable is set to a list with an operation such as <code class="code">setq</code>,
it stores the address of the first box in the variable.  Thus,
evaluation of the expression
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(setq bouquet '(rose violet buttercup))
</pre></div>

<p>creates a situation like this:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">bouquet
     |
     |     ___ ___      ___ ___      ___ ___
      --&gt; |___|___|--&gt; |___|___|--&gt; |___|___|--&gt; nil
            |            |            |
            |            |            |
             --&gt; rose     --&gt; violet   --&gt; buttercup
</pre></div></div>
<br>
<br>

<p>In this example, the symbol <code class="code">bouquet</code> holds the address of the first
pair of boxes.
</p>
<p>This same list can be illustrated in a different sort of box notation
like this:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">bouquet
 |
 |    --------------       ---------------       ----------------
 |   | car   | cdr  |     | car    | cdr  |     | car     | cdr  |
  --&gt;| rose  |   o-------&gt;| violet |   o-------&gt;| butter- |  nil |
     |       |      |     |        |      |     | cup     |      |
      --------------       ---------------       ----------------
</pre></div></div>
<br>
<br>

<p>(Symbols consist of more than pairs of addresses, but the structure of
a symbol is made up of addresses.  Indeed, the symbol <code class="code">bouquet</code>
consists of a group of address-boxes, one of which is the address of
the printed word &lsquo;<samp class="samp">bouquet</samp>&rsquo;, a second of which is the address of a
function definition attached to the symbol, if any, a third of which
is the address of the first pair of address-boxes for the list
<code class="code">(rose violet buttercup)</code>, and so on.  Here we are showing that
the symbol&rsquo;s third address-box points to the first pair of
address-boxes for the list.)
</p>
<p>If a symbol is set to the <small class="sc">CDR</small> of a list, the list itself is not
changed; the symbol simply has an address further down the list.  (In
the jargon, <small class="sc">CAR</small> and <small class="sc">CDR</small> are &ldquo;non-destructive&rdquo;.)  Thus,
evaluation of the following expression
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(setq flowers (cdr bouquet))
</pre></div>

<p>produces this:
</p>
<br>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">bouquet        flowers
  |              |
  |     ___ ___  |     ___ ___      ___ ___
   --&gt; |   |   |  --&gt; |   |   |    |   |   |
       |___|___|----&gt; |___|___|--&gt; |___|___|--&gt; nil
         |              |            |
         |              |            |
          --&gt; rose       --&gt; violet   --&gt; buttercup
</pre></div></div>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>The value of <code class="code">flowers</code> is <code class="code">(violet buttercup)</code>, which is
to say, the symbol <code class="code">flowers</code> holds the address of the pair of
address-boxes, the first of which holds the address of <code class="code">violet</code>,
and the second of which holds the address of <code class="code">buttercup</code>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dotted-pair"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-cons-cell"></a>
<p>A pair of address-boxes is called a <em class="dfn">cons cell</em> or <em class="dfn">dotted
pair</em>.  See <a data-manual="elisp" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Cons-Cell-Type.html#Cons-Cell-Type">Cons Cell and List Types</a> in <cite class="cite">The GNU Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual</cite>, and <a data-manual="elisp" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Dotted-Pair-Notation.html#Dotted-Pair-Notation">Dotted Pair
Notation</a> in <cite class="cite">The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>, for more
information about cons cells and dotted pairs.
</p>
<p>The function <code class="code">cons</code> adds a new pair of addresses to the front of
a series of addresses like that shown above.  For example, evaluating
the expression
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(setq bouquet (cons 'lily bouquet))
</pre></div>

<p>produces:
</p>
<br>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">bouquet                       flowers
  |                             |
  |     ___ ___        ___ ___  |     ___ ___       ___ ___
   --&gt; |   |   |      |   |   |  --&gt; |   |   |     |   |   |
       |___|___|----&gt; |___|___|----&gt; |___|___|----&gt;|___|___|--&gt; nil
         |              |              |             |
         |              |              |             |
          --&gt; lily      --&gt; rose       --&gt; violet    --&gt; buttercup
</pre></div></div>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>However, this does not change the value of the symbol
<code class="code">flowers</code>, as you can see by evaluating the following,
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(eq (cdr (cdr bouquet)) flowers)
</pre></div>

<p>which returns <code class="code">t</code> for true.
</p>
<p>Until it is reset, <code class="code">flowers</code> still has the value
<code class="code">(violet buttercup)</code>; that is, it has the address of the cons
cell whose first address is of <code class="code">violet</code>.  Also, this does not
alter any of the pre-existing cons cells; they are all still there.
</p>
<p>Thus, in Lisp, to get the <small class="sc">CDR</small> of a list, you just get the address
of the next cons cell in the series; to get the <small class="sc">CAR</small> of a list,
you get the address of the first element of the list; to <code class="code">cons</code> a
new element on a list, you add a new cons cell to the front of the list.
That is all there is to it!  The underlying structure of Lisp is
brilliantly simple!
</p>
<p>And what does the last address in a series of cons cells refer to?  It
is the address of the empty list, of <code class="code">nil</code>.
</p>
<p>In summary, when a Lisp variable is set to a value, it is provided with
the address of the list to which the variable refers.
