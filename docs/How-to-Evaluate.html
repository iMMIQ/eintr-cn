<p><i class="i">Whenever you give an editing command</i> to Emacs Lisp, such as the
command to move the cursor or to scroll the screen, <i class="i">you are evaluating
an expression,</i> the first element of which is a function.  <i class="i">This is
how Emacs works.</i>
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-interactive-function-defined"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-command-defined"></a>
<p>When you type keys, you cause the Lisp interpreter to evaluate an
expression and that is how you get your results.  Even typing plain text
involves evaluating an Emacs Lisp function, in this case, one that uses
<code class="code">self-insert-command</code>, which simply inserts the character you
typed.  The functions you evaluate by typing keystrokes are called
<em class="dfn">interactive</em> functions, or <em class="dfn">commands</em>; how you make a function
interactive will be illustrated in the chapter on how to write function
definitions.  See <a class="xref" href="Interactive.html">Making a Function Interactive</a>.
</p>
<p>In addition to typing keyboard commands, we have seen a second way to
evaluate an expression: by positioning the cursor after a list and
typing <kbd class="kbd">C-x C-e</kbd>.  This is what we will do in the rest of this
section.  There are other ways to evaluate an expression as well; these
will be described as we come to them.
</p>
<p>Besides being used for practicing evaluation, the functions shown in the
next few sections are important in their own right.  A study of these
functions makes clear the distinction between buffers and files, how to
switch to a buffer, and how to determine a location within it.
