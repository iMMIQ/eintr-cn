<li>Using <kbd class="kbd">C-h v</kbd> (<code class="code">describe-variable</code>), look at the value of
your kill ring.  Add several items to your kill ring; look at its
value again.  Using <kbd class="kbd">M-y</kbd> (<code class="code">yank-pop)</code>, move all the way
around the kill ring.  How many items were in your kill ring?  Find
the value of <code class="code">kill-ring-max</code>.  Was your kill ring full, or could
you have kept more blocks of text within it?

</li><li>Using <code class="code">nthcdr</code> and <code class="code">car</code>, construct a series of expressions
to return the first, second, third, and fourth elements of a list.
