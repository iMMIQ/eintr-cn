<h3 class="section" id="The-Regular-Expression-for-sentence_002dend">12.1 The Regular Expression for <code class="code">sentence-end</code></h3>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-sentence_002dend"></a>

<p>The symbol <code class="code">sentence-end</code> is bound to the pattern that marks the
end of a sentence.  What should this regular expression be?
</p>
<p>Clearly, a sentence may be ended by a period, a question mark, or an
exclamation mark.  Indeed, in English, only clauses that end with one
of those three characters should be considered the end of a sentence.
This means that the pattern should include the character set:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">[.?!]
</pre></div>

<p>However, we do not want <code class="code">forward-sentence</code> merely to jump to a
period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark, because such a character
might be used in the middle of a sentence.  A period, for example, is
used after abbreviations.  So other information is needed.
</p>
<p>According to convention, you type two spaces after every sentence, but
only one space after a period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark in
the body of a sentence.  So a period, a question mark, or an exclamation
mark followed by two spaces is a good indicator of an end of sentence.
However, in a file, the two spaces may instead be a tab or the end of a
line.  This means that the regular expression should include these three
items as alternatives.
</p>
<p>This group of alternatives will look like this:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">\\($\\| \\|  \\)
       ^   ^^
      TAB  SPC
</pre></div></div>

<p>Here, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">$</samp>&rsquo; indicates the end of the line, and I have pointed out
where the tab and two spaces are inserted in the expression.  Both are
inserted by putting the actual characters into the expression.
</p>
<p>Two backslashes, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">\\</samp>&rsquo;, are required before the parentheses and
vertical bars: the first backslash quotes the following backslash in
Emacs; and the second indicates that the following character, the
parenthesis or the vertical bar, is special.
</p>
<p>Also, a sentence may be followed by one or more carriage returns, like
this:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">[
]*
</pre></div></div>

<p>Like tabs and spaces, a carriage return is inserted into a regular
expression by inserting it literally.  The asterisk indicates that the
<kbd class="key">RET</kbd> is repeated zero or more times.
</p>
<p>But a sentence end does not consist only of a period, a question mark or
an exclamation mark followed by appropriate space: a closing quotation
mark or a closing brace of some kind may precede the space.  Indeed more
than one such mark or brace may precede the space.  These require a
expression that looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">[]\&quot;')}]*
</pre></div>

<p>In this expression, the first &lsquo;<samp class="samp">]</samp>&rsquo; is the first character in the
expression; the second character is &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&quot;</samp>&rsquo;, which is preceded by a
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">\</samp>&rsquo; to tell Emacs the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&quot;</samp>&rsquo; is <em class="emph">not</em> special.  The last
three characters are &lsquo;<samp class="samp">'</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">)</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">}</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>All this suggests what the regular expression pattern for matching the
end of a sentence should be; and, indeed, if we evaluate
<code class="code">sentence-end</code> we find that it returns the following value:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">sentence-end
     &rArr; &quot;[.?!][]\&quot;')}]*\\($\\|     \\|  \\)[
]*&quot;
</pre></div></div>

<p>(Well, not in GNU Emacs 22; that is because of an effort to make the
process simpler and to handle more glyphs and languages.  When the
value of <code class="code">sentence-end</code> is <code class="code">nil</code>, then use the value defined
by the function <code class="code">sentence-end</code>.  (Here is a use of the difference
between a value and a function in Emacs Lisp.)  The function returns a
value constructed from the variables <code class="code">sentence-end-base</code>,
<code class="code">sentence-end-double-space</code>, <code class="code">sentence-end-without-period</code>,
and <code class="code">sentence-end-without-space</code>.  The critical variable is
<code class="code">sentence-end-base</code>; its global value is similar to the one
described above but it also contains two additional quotation marks.
These have differing degrees of curliness.  The
<code class="code">sentence-end-without-period</code> variable, when true, tells Emacs
that a sentence may end without a period, such as text in Thai.)
