<p>Our goal is to construct a graph showing the numbers of function
definitions of various lengths in the Emacs lisp sources.
</p>
<p>As a practical matter, if you were creating a graph, you would
probably use a program such as <code class="code">gnuplot</code> to do the job.
(<code class="code">gnuplot</code> is nicely integrated into GNU Emacs.)  In this case,
however, we create one from scratch, and in the process we will
re-acquaint ourselves with some of what we learned before and learn
more.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will first write a simple graph printing function.
This first definition will be a <em class="dfn">prototype</em>, a rapidly written
function that enables us to reconnoiter this unknown graph-making
territory.  We will discover dragons, or find that they are myth.
After scouting the terrain, we will feel more confident and enhance
the function to label the axes automatically.
