<h4 class="unnumberedsubsubsec" id="An-argument-of-3-or-4">An argument of 3 or 4</h4>

<p>Suppose that <code class="code">triangle-recursively</code> is called with an argument of
3.
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><i class="i">Step 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- /@w --> Evaluate the do-again-test.</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <code class="code">if</code> expression is evaluated first.  This is the do-again
test and returns false, so the else-part of the <code class="code">if</code> expression
is evaluated.  (Note that in this example, the do-again-test causes
the function to call itself when it tests false, not when it tests
true.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><i class="i">Step 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- /@w --> Evaluate the innermost expression of the else-part.</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The innermost expression of the else-part is evaluated, which decrements
3 to 2.  This is the next-step-expression.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><i class="i">Step 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- /@w --> Evaluate the <code class="code">triangle-recursively</code> function.</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number 2 is passed to the <code class="code">triangle-recursively</code> function.
</p>
<p>We already know what happens when Emacs evaluates <code class="code">triangle-recursively</code> with
an argument of 2.  After going through the sequence of actions described
earlier, it returns a value of 3.  So that is what will happen here.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><i class="i">Step 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- /@w --> Evaluate the addition.</i></dt>
<dd>
<p>3 will be passed as an argument to the addition and will be added to the
number with which the function was called, which is 3.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The value returned by the function as a whole will be 6.
</p>
<p>Now that we know what will happen when <code class="code">triangle-recursively</code> is
called with an argument of 3, it is evident what will happen if it is
called with an argument of 4:
</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
<p>In the recursive call, the evaluation of
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(triangle-recursively (1- 4))
</pre></div>

<p>will return the value of evaluating
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(triangle-recursively 3)
</pre></div>

<p>which is 6 and this value will be added to 4 by the addition in the
third line.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The value returned by the function as a whole will be 10.
</p>
<p>Each time <code class="code">triangle-recursively</code> is evaluated, it evaluates a
version of itself&mdash;a different instance of itself&mdash;with a smaller
argument, until the argument is small enough so that it does not
evaluate itself.
</p>
<p>Note that this particular design for a recursive function
requires that operations be deferred.
</p>
<p>Before <code class="code">(triangle-recursively 7)</code> can calculate its answer, it
must call <code class="code">(triangle-recursively 6)</code>; and before
<code class="code">(triangle-recursively 6)</code> can calculate its answer, it must call
<code class="code">(triangle-recursively 5)</code>; and so on.  That is to say, the
calculation that <code class="code">(triangle-recursively 7)</code> makes must be
deferred until <code class="code">(triangle-recursively 6)</code> makes its calculation;
and <code class="code">(triangle-recursively 6)</code> must defer until
<code class="code">(triangle-recursively 5)</code> completes; and so on.
</p>
<p>If each of these instances of <code class="code">triangle-recursively</code> are thought
of as different robots, the first robot must wait for the second to
complete its job, which must wait until the third completes, and so
on.
</p>
<p>There is a way around this kind of waiting, which we will discuss in
<a class="ref" href="No-Deferment.html">Recursion without Deferments</a>.
