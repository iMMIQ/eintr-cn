<p>Emacs Lisp has two primary ways to cause an expression, or a series of
expressions, to be evaluated repeatedly: one uses a <code class="code">while</code>
loop, and the other uses <em class="dfn">recursion</em>.
</p>
<p>Repetition can be very valuable.  For example, to move forward four
sentences, you need only write a program that will move forward one
sentence and then repeat the process four times.  Since a computer does
not get bored or tired, such repetitive action does not have the
deleterious effects that excessive or the wrong kinds of repetition can
have on humans.
</p>
<p>People mostly write Emacs Lisp functions using <code class="code">while</code> loops and
their kin; but you can use recursion, which provides a very powerful
way to think about and then to solve problems<a class="footnote" id="DOCF12" href="#FOOT12"><sup>12</sup></a>.

<p>You can write
recursive functions to be frugal or wasteful of mental or computer
resources; as it happens, methods that people find easy&mdash;that are
frugal of mental resources&mdash;sometimes use considerable computer
resources.  Emacs was designed to run on machines that we now consider
limited and its default settings are conservative.  You may want to
increase the value of <code class="code">max-lisp-eval-depth</code>.  In my <samp class="file">.emacs</samp>
file, I set it to 30 times its default value.</p>
