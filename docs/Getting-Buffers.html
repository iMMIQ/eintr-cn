<p>The <code class="code">buffer-name</code> function returns the <em class="emph">name</em> of the buffer;
to get the buffer <em class="emph">itself</em>, a different function is needed: the
<code class="code">current-buffer</code> function.  If you use this function in code, what
you get is the buffer itself.
</p>
<p>A name and the object or entity to which the name refers are different
from each other.  You are not your name.  You are a person to whom
others refer by name.  If you ask to speak to George and someone hands you
a card with the letters &lsquo;<samp class="samp">G</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">e</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">o</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">r</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">g</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">e</samp>&rsquo; written on it, you might be amused, but you would
not be satisfied.  You do not want to speak to the name, but to the
person to whom the name refers.  A buffer is similar: the name of the
scratch buffer is <samp class="file">*scratch*</samp>, but the name is not the buffer.  To
get a buffer itself, you need to use a function such as
<code class="code">current-buffer</code>.
</p>
<p>However, there is a slight complication: if you evaluate
<code class="code">current-buffer</code> in an expression on its own, as we will do here,
what you see is a printed representation of the name of the buffer
without the contents of the buffer.  Emacs works this way for two
reasons: the buffer may be thousands of lines long&mdash;too long to be
conveniently displayed; and, another buffer may have the same contents
but a different name, and it is important to distinguish between them.
</p>
<p>Here is an expression containing the function:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(current-buffer)
</pre></div>

<p>If you evaluate this expression in Info in Emacs in the usual way,
<samp class="file">#&lt;buffer *info*&gt;</samp> will appear in the echo area.  The special
format indicates that the buffer itself is being returned, rather than
just its name.
</p>
<p>Incidentally, while you can type a number or symbol into a program, you
cannot do that with the printed representation of a buffer: the only way
to get a buffer itself is with a function such as <code class="code">current-buffer</code>.
</p>
<p>A related function is <code class="code">other-buffer</code>.  This returns the most
recently selected buffer other than the one you are in currently, not
a printed representation of its name.  If you have recently switched
back and forth from the <samp class="file">*scratch*</samp> buffer, <code class="code">other-buffer</code>
will return that buffer.
</p>
<p>You can see this by evaluating the expression:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(other-buffer)
</pre></div>

<p>You should see <samp class="file">#&lt;buffer *scratch*&gt;</samp> appear in the echo area, or
the name of whatever other buffer you switched back from most
recently<a class="footnote" id="DOCF6" href="#FOOT6"><sup>6</sup></a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="footnotes-segment">
<hr>
<h4 class="footnotes-heading">Footnotes</h4>

<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT6" href="#DOCF6">(6)</a></h5>
<p>Actually, by default, if the buffer from which you
just switched is visible to you in another window, <code class="code">other-buffer</code>
will choose the most recent buffer that you cannot see; this is a
subtlety that I often forget.</p>
