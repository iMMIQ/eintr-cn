<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="The-print_002dY_002daxis-Function-in-Detail">The <code class="code">print-Y-axis</code> Function in Detail</h4>

<p>It is easy enough to see in the figure what the Y axis label should
look like; but to say in words, and then to write a function
definition to do the job is another matter.  It is not quite true to
say that we want a number and a tic every five lines: there are only
three lines between the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">1</samp>&rsquo; and the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">5</samp>&rsquo; (lines 2, 3, and 4),
but four lines between the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">5</samp>&rsquo; and the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">10</samp>&rsquo; (lines 6, 7, 8,
and 9).  It is better to say that we want a number and a tic mark on
the base line (number 1) and then that we want a number and a tic on
the fifth line from the bottom and on every line that is a multiple of
five.
