<h3 class="section" id="Buffer-Names-1">2.1 Buffer Names</h3>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-buffer_002dname"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-buffer_002dfile_002dname"></a>

<p>The two functions, <code class="code">buffer-name</code> and <code class="code">buffer-file-name</code>, show
the difference between a file and a buffer.  When you evaluate the
following expression, <code class="code">(buffer-name)</code>, the name of the buffer
appears in the echo area.  When you evaluate <code class="code">(buffer-file-name)</code>,
the name of the file to which the buffer refers appears in the echo
area.  Usually, the name returned by <code class="code">(buffer-name)</code> is the same as
the name of the file to which it refers, and the name returned by
<code class="code">(buffer-file-name)</code> is the full path-name of the file.
</p>
<p>A file and a buffer are two different entities.  A file is information
recorded permanently in the computer (unless you delete it).  A buffer,
on the other hand, is information inside of Emacs that will vanish at
the end of the editing session (or when you kill the buffer).  Usually,
a buffer contains information that you have copied from a file; we say
the buffer is <em class="dfn">visiting</em> that file.  This copy is what you work on
and modify.  Changes to the buffer do not change the file, until you
save the buffer.  When you save the buffer, the buffer is copied to the file
and is thus saved permanently.
</p>
<p>If you are reading this in Info inside of GNU Emacs, you can evaluate
each of the following expressions by positioning the cursor after it and
typing <kbd class="kbd">C-x C-e</kbd>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(buffer-name)

(buffer-file-name)
</pre></div></div>

<p>When I do this in Info, the value returned by evaluating
<code class="code">(buffer-name)</code> is <samp class="file">&quot;*info*&quot;</samp>, and the value returned by
evaluating <code class="code">(buffer-file-name)</code> is <samp class="file">nil</samp>.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, while I am writing this document, the value
returned by evaluating <code class="code">(buffer-name)</code> is
<samp class="file">&quot;introduction.texinfo&quot;</samp>, and the value returned by evaluating
<code class="code">(buffer-file-name)</code> is
<samp class="file">&quot;/gnu/work/intro/introduction.texinfo&quot;</samp>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-nil_002c-history-of-word"></a>
<p>The former is the name of the buffer and the latter is the name of the
file.  In Info, the buffer name is <samp class="file">&quot;*info*&quot;</samp>.  Info does not
point to any file, so the result of evaluating
<code class="code">(buffer-file-name)</code> is <samp class="file">nil</samp>.  The symbol <code class="code">nil</code> is
from the Latin word for &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;; in this case, it means that the
buffer is not associated with any file.  (In Lisp, <code class="code">nil</code> is also
used to mean &ldquo;false&rdquo; and is a synonym for the empty list, <code class="code">()</code>.)
</p>
<p>When I am writing, the name of my buffer is
<samp class="file">&quot;introduction.texinfo&quot;</samp>.  The name of the file to which it
points is <samp class="file">&quot;/gnu/work/intro/introduction.texinfo&quot;</samp>.
</p>
<p>(In the expressions, the parentheses tell the Lisp interpreter to
treat <code class="code"><span class="w-nolinebreak-text">buffer-name</span></code><!-- /@w --> and <code class="code"><span class="w-nolinebreak-text">buffer-file-name</span></code><!-- /@w --> as
functions; without the parentheses, the interpreter would attempt to
evaluate the symbols as variables.  See <a class="xref" href="Variables.html">Variables</a>.)
</p>
<p>In spite of the distinction between files and buffers, you will often
find that people refer to a file when they mean a buffer and vice versa.
Indeed, most people say, &ldquo;I am editing a file,&rdquo; rather than saying,
&ldquo;I am editing a buffer which I will soon save to a file.&rdquo;  It is
almost always clear from context what people mean.  When dealing with
computer programs, however, it is important to keep the distinction in mind,
since the computer is not as smart as a person.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Buffer_002c-history-of-word"></a>
<p>The word &ldquo;buffer&rdquo;, by the way, comes from the meaning of the word as a
cushion that deadens the force of a collision.  In early computers, a
buffer cushioned the interaction between files and the computer&rsquo;s
central processing unit.  The drums or tapes that held a file and the
central processing unit were pieces of equipment that were very
different from each other, working at their own speeds, in spurts.  The
buffer made it possible for them to work together effectively.
Eventually, the buffer grew from being an intermediary, a temporary
holding place, to being the place where work is done.  This
transformation is rather like that of a small seaport that grew into a
great city: once it was merely the place where cargo was warehoused
temporarily before being loaded onto ships; then it became a business
and cultural center in its own right.
</p>
<p>Not all buffers are associated with files.  For example, a
<samp class="file">*scratch*</samp> buffer does not visit any file.  Similarly, a
<samp class="file">*Help*</samp> buffer is not associated with any file.
</p>
<p>In the old days, when you lacked a <samp class="file">~/.emacs</samp> file and started an
Emacs session by typing the command <code class="code">emacs</code> alone, without naming
any files, Emacs started with the <samp class="file">*scratch*</samp> buffer visible.
Nowadays, you will see a splash screen.  You can follow one of the
commands suggested on the splash screen, visit a file, or press <kbd class="kbd">q</kbd>
to quit the splash screen and reach the <samp class="file">*scratch*</samp> buffer.
</p>
<p>If you switch to the <samp class="file">*scratch*</samp> buffer, type
<code class="code">(buffer-name)</code>, position the cursor after it, and then type
<kbd class="kbd">C-x C-e</kbd> to evaluate the expression.  The name <code class="code">&quot;*scratch*&quot;</code>
will be returned and will appear in the echo area.  <code class="code">&quot;*scratch*&quot;</code>
is the name of the buffer.  When you type <code class="code">(buffer-file-name)</code> in
the <samp class="file">*scratch*</samp> buffer and evaluate that, <code class="code">nil</code> will appear
in the echo area, just as it does when you evaluate
<code class="code">(buffer-file-name)</code> in Info.
</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you are in the <samp class="file">*scratch*</samp> buffer and want the
value returned by an expression to appear in the <samp class="file">*scratch*</samp>
buffer itself rather than in the echo area, type <kbd class="kbd">C-u C-x C-e</kbd>
instead of <kbd class="kbd">C-x C-e</kbd>.  This causes the value returned to appear
after the expression.  The buffer will look like this:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(buffer-name)&quot;*scratch*&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>You cannot do this in Info since Info is read-only and it will not allow
you to change the contents of the buffer.  But you can do this in any
buffer you can edit; and when you write code or documentation (such as
this book), this feature is very useful.
