<p>The <code class="code">what-line</code> command tells you the number of the line in which
the cursor is located.  The function illustrates the use of the
<code class="code">save-restriction</code> and <code class="code">save-excursion</code> commands.  Here is the
original text of the function:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(defun what-line ()
  &quot;Print the current line number (in the buffer) of point.&quot;
  (interactive)
  (save-restriction
    (widen)
    (save-excursion
      (beginning-of-line)
      (message &quot;Line %d&quot;
               (1+ (count-lines 1 (point)))))))
</pre></div></div>

<p>(In modern versions of GNU Emacs, the <code class="code">what-line</code> function has
been expanded to tell you your line number in a narrowed buffer as
well as your line number in a widened buffer.  The modern version is
more complex than the version shown here.  If you feel adventurous,
you might want to look at it after figuring out how this version
works.  You will probably need to use <kbd class="kbd">C-h f</kbd>
(<code class="code">describe-function</code>).  The newer version uses a conditional to
determine whether the buffer has been narrowed.
</p>
<p>Also, the modern version of <code class="code">what-line</code> uses
<code class="code">line-number-at-pos</code>, which among other simple expressions, such
as <code class="code">(goto-char (point-min))</code>, moves point to the beginning of the
current line with <code class="code">(forward-line 0)</code> rather than
<code class="code">beginning-of-line</code>.)
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">what-line</code> function as shown here has a documentation line
and is interactive, as you would expect.  The next two lines use the
functions <code class="code">save-restriction</code> and <code class="code">widen</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">save-restriction</code> special form notes whatever narrowing is in
effect, if any, in the current buffer and restores that narrowing after
the code in the body of the <code class="code">save-restriction</code> has been evaluated.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">save-restriction</code> special form is followed by <code class="code">widen</code>.
This function undoes any narrowing the current buffer may have had
when <code class="code">what-line</code> was called.  (The narrowing that was there is
the narrowing that <code class="code">save-restriction</code> remembers.)  This widening
makes it possible for the line counting commands to count from the
beginning of the buffer.  Otherwise, they would have been limited to
counting within the accessible region.  Any original narrowing is
restored just before the completion of the function by the
<code class="code">save-restriction</code> special form.
</p>
<p>The call to <code class="code">widen</code> is followed by <code class="code">save-excursion</code>, which
saves the location of the cursor (i.e., of point), and
restores it after the code in the body of the <code class="code">save-excursion</code>
uses the <code class="code">beginning-of-line</code> function to move point.
</p>
<p>(Note that the <code class="code">(widen)</code> expression comes between the
<code class="code">save-restriction</code> and <code class="code">save-excursion</code> special forms.  When
you write the two <code class="code">save- &hellip;</code> expressions in sequence, write
<code class="code">save-excursion</code> outermost.)
</p>
<p>The last two lines of the <code class="code">what-line</code> function are functions to
count the number of lines in the buffer and then print the number in the
echo area.
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(message &quot;Line %d&quot;
         (1+ (count-lines 1 (point)))))))
</pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="code">message</code> function prints a one-line message at the bottom of
the Emacs screen.  The first argument is inside of quotation marks and
is printed as a string of characters.  However, it may contain a
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">%d</samp>&rsquo; expression to print a following argument.  &lsquo;<samp class="samp">%d</samp>&rsquo; prints
the argument as a decimal, so the message will say something such as
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">Line 243</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The number that is printed in place of the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">%d</samp>&rsquo; is computed by the
last line of the function:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(1+ (count-lines 1 (point)))
</pre></div>


<p>What this does is count the lines from the first position of the
buffer, indicated by the <code class="code">1</code>, up to <code class="code">(point)</code>, and then add
one to that number.  (The <code class="code">1+</code> function adds one to its
argument.)  We add one to it because line 2 has only one line before
it, and <code class="code">count-lines</code> counts only the lines <em class="emph">before</em> the
current line.
</p>
<p>After <code class="code">count-lines</code> has done its job, and the message has been
printed in the echo area, the <code class="code">save-excursion</code> restores point to
its original position; and <code class="code">save-restriction</code> restores
the original narrowing, if any.
