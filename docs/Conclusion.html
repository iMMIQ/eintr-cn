<h2 class="chapter" id="Conclusion-1">18 Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have now reached the end of this Introduction.  You have now
learned enough about programming in Emacs Lisp to set values, to write
simple <samp class="file">.emacs</samp> files for yourself and your friends, and write
simple customizations and extensions to Emacs.
</p>
<p>This is a place to stop.  Or, if you wish, you can now go onward, and
teach yourself.
</p>
<p>You have learned some of the basic nuts and bolts of programming.  But
only some.  There are a great many more brackets and hinges that are
easy to use that we have not touched.
</p>
<p>A path you can follow right now lies among the sources to GNU Emacs
and in
<cite class="cite">The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>.
</p>
<p>The Emacs Lisp sources are an adventure.  When you read the sources and
come across a function or expression that is unfamiliar, you need to
figure out or find out what it does.
</p>
<p>Go to the Reference Manual.  It is a thorough, complete, and fairly
easy-to-read description of Emacs Lisp.  It is written not only for
experts, but for people who know what you know.  (The <cite class="cite">Reference
Manual</cite> comes with the standard GNU Emacs distribution.  Like this
introduction, it comes as a Texinfo source file, so you can read it
on your computer and as a typeset, printed book.)
</p>
<p>Go to the other built-in help that is part of GNU Emacs: the built-in
documentation for all functions and variables, and
<code class="code">xref-find-definitions</code>, the program that takes you to sources.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of how I explore the sources.  Because of its name,
<samp class="file">simple.el</samp> is the file I looked at first, a long time ago.  As
it happens some of the functions in <samp class="file">simple.el</samp> are complicated,
or at least look complicated at first sight.  The <code class="code">open-line</code>
function, for example, looks complicated.
</p>
<p>You may want to walk through this function slowly, as we did with the
<code class="code">forward-sentence</code> function.  (See <a class="xref" href="forward_002dsentence.html">The
<code class="code">forward-sentence</code> function</a>.)  Or you may want to skip that
function and look at another, such as <code class="code">split-line</code>.  You don&rsquo;t
need to read all the functions.  According to
<code class="code">count-words-in-defun</code>, the <code class="code">split-line</code> function contains
102 words and symbols.
</p>
<p>Even though it is short, <code class="code">split-line</code> contains  expressions
we have not studied: <code class="code">skip-chars-forward</code>, <code class="code">indent-to</code>,
<code class="code">current-column</code> and <code class="code">insert-and-inherit</code>.
</p>
<p>Consider the <code class="code">skip-chars-forward</code> function.
In GNU Emacs, you can find out more about <code class="code">skip-chars-forward</code> by
typing <kbd class="kbd">C-h f</kbd> (<code class="code">describe-function</code>) and the name of the
function.  This gives you the function documentation.
</p>
<p>You may be able to guess what is done by a well named function such as
<code class="code">indent-to</code>; or you can look it up, too.  Incidentally, the
<code class="code">describe-function</code> function itself is in <samp class="file">help.el</samp>; it is
one of those long, but decipherable functions.  You can look up
<code class="code">describe-function</code> using the <kbd class="kbd">C-h f</kbd> command!
</p>
<p>In this instance, since the code is Lisp, the <samp class="file">*Help*</samp> buffer
contains the name of the library containing the function&rsquo;s source.
You can put point over the name of the library and press the <kbd class="key">RET</kbd> key,
which in this situation is bound to <code class="code">help-follow</code>, and be taken
directly to the source, in the same way as <kbd class="kbd">M-.</kbd>
(<code class="code">xref-find-definitions</code>).
</p>
<p>The definition for <code class="code">describe-function</code> illustrates how to
customize the <code class="code">interactive</code> expression without using the standard
character codes; and it shows how to create a temporary buffer.
</p>
<p>(The <code class="code">indent-to</code> function is written in C rather than Emacs Lisp;
it is a built-in function.  <code class="code">help-follow</code> takes you to its
source as does <code class="code">xref-find-definitions</code>, when properly set up.)
</p>
<p>You can look at a function&rsquo;s source using
<code class="code">xref-find-definitions</code>, which is bound to <kbd class="kbd">M-.</kbd>  Finally,
you can find out what the Reference Manual has to say by visiting the
manual in Info, and typing <kbd class="kbd">i</kbd> (<code class="code">Info-index</code>) and the name of
the function, or by looking up the function in the index to a printed
copy of the manual.
</p>
<p>Similarly, you can find out what is meant by
<code class="code">insert-and-inherit</code>.
</p>
<p>Other interesting source files include <samp class="file">paragraphs.el</samp>,
<samp class="file">loaddefs.el</samp>, and <samp class="file">loadup.el</samp>.  The <samp class="file">paragraphs.el</samp>
file includes short, easily understood functions as well as longer
ones.  The <samp class="file">loaddefs.el</samp> file contains the many standard
autoloads and many keymaps.  I have never looked at it all; only at
parts.  <samp class="file">loadup.el</samp> is the file that loads the standard parts of
Emacs; it tells you a great deal about how Emacs is built.
(See <a data-manual="elisp" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Building-Emacs.html#Building-Emacs">Building Emacs</a> in <cite class="cite">The GNU Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual</cite>, for more about building.)
</p>
<p>As I said, you have learned some nuts and bolts; however, and very
importantly, we have hardly touched major aspects of programming; I
have said nothing about how to sort information, except to use the
predefined <code class="code">sort</code> function; I have said nothing about how to store
information, except to use variables and lists; I have said nothing
about how to write programs that write programs.  These are topics for
another, and different kind of book, a different kind of learning.
</p>
<p>What you have done is learn enough for much practical work with GNU
Emacs.  What you have done is get started.  This is the end of a
beginning.
