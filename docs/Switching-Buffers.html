<h3 class="section" id="Switching-Buffers-1">2.3 Switching Buffers</h3>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-switch_002dto_002dbuffer"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-set_002dbuffer"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Switching-to-a-buffer"></a>

<p>The <code class="code">other-buffer</code> function actually provides a buffer when it is
used as an argument to a function that requires one.  We can see this
by using <code class="code">other-buffer</code> and <code class="code">switch-to-buffer</code> to switch to a
different buffer.
</p>
<p>But first, a brief introduction to the <code class="code">switch-to-buffer</code>
function.  When you switched back and forth from Info to the
<samp class="file">*scratch*</samp> buffer to evaluate <code class="code">(buffer-name)</code>, you most
likely typed <kbd class="kbd">C-x b</kbd> and then typed <samp class="file">*scratch*</samp><a class="footnote" id="DOCF7" href="#FOOT7"><sup>7</sup></a> when prompted in the minibuffer for the name of
the buffer to which you wanted to switch.  The keystrokes, <kbd class="kbd">C-x
b</kbd>, cause the Lisp interpreter to evaluate the interactive function
<code class="code">switch-to-buffer</code>.  As we said before, this is how Emacs works:
different keystrokes call or run different functions.  For example,
<kbd class="kbd">C-f</kbd> calls <code class="code">forward-char</code>, <kbd class="kbd">M-e</kbd> calls
<code class="code">forward-sentence</code>, and so on.
</p>
<p>By writing <code class="code">switch-to-buffer</code> in an expression, and giving it a
buffer to switch to, we can switch buffers just the way <kbd class="kbd">C-x b</kbd>
does:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(switch-to-buffer (other-buffer))
</pre></div>

<p>The symbol <code class="code">switch-to-buffer</code> is the first element of the list,
so the Lisp interpreter will treat it as a function and carry out the
instructions that are attached to it.  But before doing that, the
interpreter will note that <code class="code">other-buffer</code> is inside parentheses
and work on that symbol first.  <code class="code">other-buffer</code> is the first (and
in this case, the only) element of this list, so the Lisp interpreter
calls or runs the function.  It returns another buffer.  Next, the
interpreter runs <code class="code">switch-to-buffer</code>, passing to it, as an
argument, the other buffer, which is what Emacs will switch to.  If
you are reading this in Info, try this now.  Evaluate the expression.
(To get back, type <kbd class="kbd">C-x b <kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd>.)<a class="footnote" id="DOCF8" href="#FOOT8"><sup>8</sup></a>
</p>
<p>In the programming examples in later sections of this document, you will
see the function <code class="code">set-buffer</code> more often than
<code class="code">switch-to-buffer</code>.  This is because of a difference between
computer programs and humans: humans have eyes and expect to see the
buffer on which they are working on their computer terminals.  This is
so obvious, it almost goes without saying.  However, programs do not
have eyes.  When a computer program works on a buffer, that buffer does
not need to be visible on the screen.
</p>
<p><code class="code">switch-to-buffer</code> is designed for humans and does two different
things: it switches the buffer to which Emacs&rsquo;s attention is directed; and
it switches the buffer displayed in the window to the new buffer.
<code class="code">set-buffer</code>, on the other hand, does only one thing: it switches
the attention of the computer program to a different buffer.  The buffer
on the screen remains unchanged (of course, normally nothing happens
there until the command finishes running).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-call-defined"></a>
<p>Also, we have just introduced another jargon term, the word <em class="dfn">call</em>.
When you evaluate a list in which the first symbol is a function, you
are calling that function.  The use of the term comes from the notion of
the function as an entity that can do something for you if you call
it&mdash;just as a plumber is an entity who can fix a leak if you call him
or her.

<h4 class="footnotes-heading">Footnotes</h4>

<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT7" href="#DOCF7">(7)</a></h5>
<p>Or
rather, to save typing, you probably only typed <kbd class="kbd">RET</kbd> if the
default buffer was <samp class="file">*scratch*</samp>, or if it was different, then you
typed just part of the name, such as <code class="code">*sc</code>, pressed your
<kbd class="kbd">TAB</kbd> key to cause it to expand to the full name, and then typed
<kbd class="kbd">RET</kbd>.</p>
<h5 class="footnote-body-heading"><a id="FOOT8" href="#DOCF8">(8)</a></h5>
<p>Remember, this
expression will move you to your most recent other buffer that you
cannot see.  If you really want to go to your most recently selected
buffer, even if you can still see it, you need to evaluate the
following more complex expression:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(switch-to-buffer (other-buffer (current-buffer) t))
</pre></div>

<p>In this case, the first argument to <code class="code">other-buffer</code> tells it which
buffer to skip&mdash;the current one&mdash;and the second argument tells
<code class="code">other-buffer</code> it is OK to switch to a visible buffer.  In
regular use, <code class="code">switch-to-buffer</code> takes you to a buffer not visible
in windows since you would most likely use <kbd class="kbd">C-x o</kbd>
(<code class="code">other-window</code>) to go to another visible buffer.</p>
