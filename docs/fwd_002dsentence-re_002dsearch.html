<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec" id="The-regular-expression-search">The regular expression search</h4>

<p>The <code class="code">re-search-forward</code> function searches for the end of the
sentence, that is, for the pattern defined by the <code class="code">sentence-end</code>
regular expression.  If the pattern is found&mdash;if the end of the sentence is
found&mdash;then the <code class="code">re-search-forward</code> function does two things:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> The <code class="code">re-search-forward</code> function carries out a side effect, which
is to move point to the end of the occurrence found.

</li><li> The <code class="code">re-search-forward</code> function returns a value of true.  This is
the value received by the <code class="code">if</code>, and means that the search was
successful.
</li></ol>

<p>The side effect, the movement of point, is completed before the
<code class="code">if</code> function is handed the value returned by the successful
conclusion of the search.
</p>
<p>When the <code class="code">if</code> function receives the value of true from a successful
call to <code class="code">re-search-forward</code>, the <code class="code">if</code> evaluates the then-part,
which is the expression <code class="code">(skip-chars-backward &quot; \t\n&quot;)</code>.  This
expression moves backwards over any blank spaces, tabs or carriage
returns until a printed character is found and then leaves point after
the character.  Since point has already been moved to the end of the
pattern that marks the end of the sentence, this action leaves point
right after the closing printed character of the sentence, which is
usually a period.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the <code class="code">re-search-forward</code> function fails to
find a pattern marking the end of the sentence, the function returns
false.  The false then causes the <code class="code">if</code> to evaluate its third
argument, which is <code class="code">(goto-char par-end)</code>:  it moves point to the
end of the paragraph.
</p>
<p>(And if the text is in a form or equivalent, and point may not move
fully, then the <code class="code">constrain-to-field</code> function comes into play.)
</p>
<p>Regular expression searches are exceptionally useful and the pattern
illustrated by <code class="code">re-search-forward</code>, in which the search is the
test of an <code class="code">if</code> expression, is handy.  You will see or write code
incorporating this pattern often.
