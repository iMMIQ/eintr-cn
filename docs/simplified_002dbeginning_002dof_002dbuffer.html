<h3 class="section" id="A-Simplified-beginning_002dof_002dbuffer-Definition">4.2 A Simplified <code class="code">beginning-of-buffer</code> Definition</h3>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-simplified_002dbeginning_002dof_002dbuffer"></a>

<p>The <code class="code">beginning-of-buffer</code> command is a good function to start with
since you are likely to be familiar with it and it is easy to
understand.  Used as an interactive command, <code class="code">beginning-of-buffer</code>
moves the cursor to the beginning of the buffer, leaving the mark at the
previous position.  It is generally bound to <kbd class="kbd">M-&lt;</kbd>.
</p>
<p>In this section, we will discuss a shortened version of the function
that shows how it is most frequently used.  This shortened function
works as written, but it does not contain the code for a complex option.
In another section, we will describe the entire function.
(See <a class="xref" href="beginning_002dof_002dbuffer.html">Complete Definition of
<code class="code">beginning-of-buffer</code></a>.)
</p>
<p>Before looking at the code, let&rsquo;s consider what the function
definition has to contain: it must include an expression that makes
the function interactive so it can be called by typing <kbd class="kbd">M-x
beginning-of-buffer</kbd> or by typing a keychord such as <kbd class="kbd">M-&lt;</kbd>; it
must include code to leave a mark at the original position in the
buffer; and it must include code to move the cursor to the beginning
of the buffer.
</p>
<p>Here is the complete text of the shortened version of the function:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(defun simplified-beginning-of-buffer ()
  &quot;Move point to the beginning of the buffer;
leave mark at previous position.&quot;
  (interactive)
  (push-mark)
  (goto-char (point-min)))
</pre></div></div>

<p>Like all function definitions, this definition has five parts following
the macro <code class="code">defun</code>:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> The name: in this example, <code class="code">simplified-beginning-of-buffer</code>.

</li><li> A list of the arguments: in this example, an empty list, <code class="code">()</code>,

</li><li> The documentation string.

</li><li> The interactive expression.

</li><li> The body.
</li></ol>

<p>In this function definition, the argument list is empty; this means that
this function does not require any arguments.  (When we look at the
definition for the complete function, we will see that it may be passed
an optional argument.)
</p>
<p>The interactive expression tells Emacs that the function is intended to
be used interactively.  In this example, <code class="code">interactive</code> does not have
an argument because <code class="code">simplified-beginning-of-buffer</code> does not
require one.
</p>
<p>The body of the function consists of the two lines:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(push-mark)
(goto-char (point-min))
</pre></div></div>

<p>The first of these lines is the expression, <code class="code">(push-mark)</code>.  When
this expression is evaluated by the Lisp interpreter, it sets a mark at
the current position of the cursor, wherever that may be.  The position
of this mark is saved in the mark ring.
</p>
<p>The next line is <code class="code">(goto-char (point-min))</code>.  This expression
jumps the cursor to the minimum point in the buffer, that is, to the
beginning of the buffer (or to the beginning of the accessible portion
of the buffer if it is narrowed.  See <a class="xref" href="Narrowing-_0026-Widening.html">Narrowing and Widening</a>.)
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">push-mark</code> command sets a mark at the place where the cursor
was located before it was moved to the beginning of the buffer by the
<code class="code">(goto-char (point-min))</code> expression.  Consequently, you can, if
you wish, go back to where you were originally by typing <kbd class="kbd">C-x C-x</kbd>.
</p>
<p>That is all there is to the function definition!
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-describe_002dfunction"></a>
<p>When you are reading code such as this and come upon an unfamiliar
function, such as <code class="code">goto-char</code>, you can find out what it does by
using the <code class="code">describe-function</code> command.  To use this command, type
<kbd class="kbd">C-h f</kbd> and then type in the name of the function and press
<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>.  The <code class="code">describe-function</code> command will print the
function&rsquo;s documentation string in a <samp class="file">*Help*</samp> window.  For
example, the documentation for <code class="code">goto-char</code> is:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">Set point to POSITION, a number or marker.
Beginning of buffer is position (point-min), end is (point-max).
</pre></div></div>

<p>The function&rsquo;s one argument is the desired position.
</p>
<p>(The prompt for <code class="code">describe-function</code> will offer you the symbol
under or preceding the cursor, so you can save typing by positioning
the cursor right over or after the function and then typing <kbd class="kbd">C-h f
<kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd>.)
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">end-of-buffer</code> function definition is written in the same way as
the <code class="code">beginning-of-buffer</code> definition except that the body of the
function contains the expression <code class="code">(goto-char (point-max))</code> in place
of <code class="code">(goto-char (point-min))</code>.
