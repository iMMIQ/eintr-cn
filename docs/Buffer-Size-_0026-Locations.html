<h3 class="section" id="Buffer-Size-and-the-Location-of-Point">2.4 Buffer Size and the Location of Point</h3>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Size-of-buffer"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Buffer-size"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Point-location"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Location-of-point"></a>

<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s look at several rather simple functions,
<code class="code">buffer-size</code>, <code class="code">point</code>, <code class="code">point-min</code>, and
<code class="code">point-max</code>.  These give information about the size of a buffer and
the location of point within it.
</p>
<p>The function <code class="code">buffer-size</code> tells you the size of the current
buffer; that is, the function returns a count of the number of
characters in the buffer.
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(buffer-size)
</pre></div>

<p>You can evaluate this in the usual way, by positioning the
cursor after the expression and typing <kbd class="kbd">C-x C-e</kbd>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-point-defined"></a>
<p>In Emacs, the current  position of the cursor is called <em class="dfn">point</em>.
The expression <code class="code">(point)</code> returns a number that tells you where the
cursor is located as a count of the number of characters from the
beginning of the buffer up to point.
</p>
<p>You can see the character count for point in this buffer by evaluating
the following expression in the usual way:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(point)
</pre></div>

<p>As I write this, the value of point is 65724.  The <code class="code">point</code>
function is frequently used in some of the examples later in this
book.
</p>
<p>The value of point depends, of course, on its location within the
buffer.  If you evaluate point in this spot, the number will be larger:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(point)
</pre></div>

<p>For me, the value of point in this location is 66043, which means that
there are 319 characters (including spaces) between the two
expressions.  (Doubtless, you will see different numbers, since I will
have edited this since I first evaluated point.)
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-narrowing-defined"></a>
<p>The function <code class="code">point-min</code> is somewhat similar to <code class="code">point</code>, but
it returns the value of the minimum permissible value of point in the
current buffer.  This is the number 1 unless <em class="dfn">narrowing</em> is in
effect.  (Narrowing is a mechanism whereby you can restrict yourself,
or a program, to operations on just a part of a buffer.
See <a class="xref" href="Narrowing-_0026-Widening.html">Narrowing and Widening</a>.)  Likewise, the
function <code class="code">point-max</code> returns the value of the maximum permissible
value of point in the current buffer.
