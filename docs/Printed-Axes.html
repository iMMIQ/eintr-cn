<h3 class="section" id="Need-for-Printed-Axes">15.3 Need for Printed Axes</h3>

<p>A graph needs printed axes, so you can orient yourself.  For a do-once
project, it may be reasonable to draw the axes by hand using Emacs&rsquo;s
Picture mode; but a graph drawing function may be used more than once.
</p>
<p>For this reason, I have written enhancements to the basic
<code class="code">print-graph-body</code> function that automatically print labels for
the horizontal and vertical axes.  Since the label printing functions
do not contain much new material, I have placed their description in
an appendix.  See <a class="xref" href="Full-Graph.html">A Graph with Labeled Axes</a>.
