<h4 class="subsection" id="Using-set-1">1.9.1 Using <code class="code">set</code></h4>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-set"></a>

<p>To set the value of the symbol <code class="code">flowers</code> to the list <code class="code">'(rose
violet daisy buttercup)</code>, evaluate the following expression by
positioning the cursor after the expression and typing <kbd class="kbd">C-x C-e</kbd>.
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(set 'flowers '(rose violet daisy buttercup))
</pre></div>

<p>The list <code class="code">(rose violet daisy buttercup)</code> will appear in the echo
area.  This is what is <em class="emph">returned</em> by the <code class="code">set</code> function.  As a
side effect, the symbol <code class="code">flowers</code> is bound to the list; that is,
the symbol <code class="code">flowers</code>, which can be viewed as a variable, is given
the list as its value.  (This process, by the way, illustrates how a
side effect to the Lisp interpreter, setting the value, can be the
primary effect that we humans are interested in.  This is because every
Lisp function must return a value if it does not get an error, but it
will only have a side effect if it is designed to have one.)
</p>
<p>After evaluating the <code class="code">set</code> expression, you can evaluate the symbol
<code class="code">flowers</code> and it will return the value you just set.  Here is the
symbol.  Place your cursor after it and type <kbd class="kbd">C-x C-e</kbd>.
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">flowers
</pre></div>

<p>When you evaluate <code class="code">flowers</code>, the list
<code class="code">(rose violet daisy buttercup)</code> appears in the echo area.
</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you evaluate <code class="code">'flowers</code>, the variable with a quote
in front of it, what you will see in the echo area is the symbol itself,
<code class="code">flowers</code>.  Here is the quoted symbol, so you can try this:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">'flowers
</pre></div>

<p>Note also, that when you use <code class="code">set</code>, you need to quote both
arguments to <code class="code">set</code>, unless you want them evaluated.  Since we do
not want either argument evaluated, neither the variable
<code class="code">flowers</code> nor the list <code class="code">(rose violet daisy buttercup)</code>, both
are quoted.  (When you use <code class="code">set</code> without quoting its first
argument, the first argument is evaluated before anything else is
done.  If you did this and <code class="code">flowers</code> did not have a value
already, you would get an error message that the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">Symbol's value
as variable is void</samp>&rsquo;; on the other hand, if <code class="code">flowers</code> did return
a value after it was evaluated, the <code class="code">set</code> would attempt to set
the value that was returned.  There are situations where this is the
right thing for the function to do; but such situations are rare.)
