<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Parts-of-a-Recursive-Definition"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Recursive-Definition-Parts"></a>

<p>A recursive function typically contains a conditional expression which
has three parts:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> A true-or-false-test that determines whether the function is called
again, here called the <em class="dfn">do-again-test</em>.

</li><li> The name of the function.  When this name is called, a new instance of
the function&mdash;a new robot, as it were&mdash;is created and told what to do.

</li><li> An expression that returns a different value each time the function is
called, here called the <em class="dfn">next-step-expression</em>.  Consequently, the
argument (or arguments) passed to the new instance of the function
will be different from that passed to the previous instance.  This
causes the conditional expression, the <em class="dfn">do-again-test</em>, to test
false after the correct number of repetitions.
</li></ol>

<p>Recursive functions can be much simpler than any other kind of
function.  Indeed, when people first start to use them, they often look
so mysteriously simple as to be incomprehensible.  Like riding a
bicycle, reading a recursive function definition takes a certain knack
which is hard at first but then seems simple.
</p>
<p>There are several different common recursive patterns.  A very simple
pattern looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">(defun <var class="var">name-of-recursive-function</var> (<var class="var">argument-list</var>)
  &quot;<var class="var">documentation</var>&hellip;&quot;
  (if <var class="var">do-again-test</var>
    <var class="var">body</var>&hellip;
    (<var class="var">name-of-recursive-function</var>
         <var class="var">next-step-expression</var>)))
</pre></div></div>

<p>Each time a recursive function is evaluated, a new instance of it is
created and told what to do.  The arguments tell the instance what to do.
</p>
<p>An argument is bound to the value of the next-step-expression.  Each
instance runs with a different value of the next-step-expression.
</p>
<p>The value in the next-step-expression is used in the do-again-test.
</p>
<p>The value returned by the next-step-expression is passed to the new
instance of the function, which evaluates it (or some
transmogrification of it) to determine whether to continue or stop.
The next-step-expression is designed so that the do-again-test returns
false when the function should no longer be repeated.
</p>
<p>The do-again-test is sometimes called the <em class="dfn">stop condition</em>,
since it stops the repetitions when it tests false.
