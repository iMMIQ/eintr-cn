<p>There is an important aspect to the truth test in an <code class="code">if</code>
expression.  So far, we have spoken of &ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;false&rdquo; as values of
predicates as if they were new kinds of Emacs Lisp objects.  In fact,
&ldquo;false&rdquo; is just our old friend <code class="code">nil</code>.  Anything else&mdash;anything
at all&mdash;is &ldquo;true&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The expression that tests for truth is interpreted as <em class="dfn">true</em>
if the result of evaluating it is a value that is not <code class="code">nil</code>.  In
other words, the result of the test is considered true if the value
returned is a number such as 47, a string such as <code class="code">&quot;hello&quot;</code>, or a
symbol (other than <code class="code">nil</code>) such as <code class="code">flowers</code>, or a list (so
long as it is not empty), or even a buffer!
