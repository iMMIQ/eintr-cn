<h3 class="section" id="The-kill_002dring_002dyank_002dpointer-Variable">10.2 The <code class="code">kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> Variable</h3>

<p><code class="code">kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> is a variable, just as <code class="code">kill-ring</code> is
a variable.  It points to something by being bound to the value of what
it points to, like any other Lisp variable.
</p>
<p>Thus, if the value of the kill ring is:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(&quot;some text&quot; &quot;a different piece of text&quot; &quot;yet more text&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>and the <code class="code">kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> points to the second clause, the
value of <code class="code">kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> is:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(&quot;a different piece of text&quot; &quot;yet more text&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>As explained in the previous chapter (see <a class="pxref" href="List-Implementation.html">How Lists are Implemented</a>), the
computer does not keep two different copies of the text being pointed to
by both the <code class="code">kill-ring</code> and the <code class="code">kill-ring-yank-pointer</code>.  The
words &ldquo;a different piece of text&rdquo; and &ldquo;yet more text&rdquo; are not
duplicated.  Instead, the two Lisp variables point to the same pieces of
text.  Here is a diagram:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">kill-ring     kill-ring-yank-pointer
    |               |
    |      ___ ___  |     ___ ___      ___ ___
     ---&gt; |   |   |  --&gt; |   |   |    |   |   |
          |___|___|----&gt; |___|___|--&gt; |___|___|--&gt; nil
            |              |            |
            |              |            |
            |              |             --&gt; &quot;yet more text&quot;
            |              |
            |               --&gt; &quot;a different piece of text&quot;
            |
             --&gt; &quot;some text&quot;
</pre></div></div>

<p>Both the variable <code class="code">kill-ring</code> and the variable
<code class="code">kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> are pointers.  But the kill ring itself is
usually described as if it were actually what it is composed of.  The
<code class="code">kill-ring</code> is spoken of as if it were the list rather than that it
points to the list.  Conversely, the <code class="code">kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> is
spoken of as pointing to a list.
</p>
<p>These two ways of talking about the same thing sound confusing at first but
make sense on reflection.  The kill ring is generally thought of as the
complete structure of data that holds the information of what has recently
been cut out of the Emacs buffers.  The <code class="code">kill-ring-yank-pointer</code>
on the other hand, serves to indicate&mdash;that is, to point to&mdash;that part
of the kill ring of which the first element (the <small class="sc">CAR</small>) will be
inserted.
