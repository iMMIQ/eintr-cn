<p>In Emacs Lisp, a symbol can have a value attached to it just as it can
have a function definition attached to it.  The two are different.
The function definition is a set of instructions that a computer will
obey.  A value, on the other hand, is something, such as number or a
name, that can vary (which is why such a symbol is called a variable).
The value of a symbol can be any expression in Lisp, such as a symbol,
number, list, or string.  A symbol that has a value is often called a
<em class="dfn">variable</em>.
</p>
<p>A symbol can have both a function definition and a value attached to
it at the same time.  Or it can have just one or the other.
The two are separate.  This is somewhat similar
to the way the name Cambridge can refer to the city in Massachusetts
and have some information attached to the name as well, such as
&ldquo;great programming center&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>Another way to think about this is to imagine a symbol as being a chest
of drawers.  The function definition is put in one drawer, the value in
another, and so on.  What is put in the drawer holding the value can be
changed without affecting the contents of the drawer holding the
function definition, and vice versa.
