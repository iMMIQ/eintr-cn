<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Kill-ring-overview"></a>

<p>The kill ring is a list of textual strings.  This is what it looks like:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(&quot;some text&quot; &quot;a different piece of text&quot; &quot;yet more text&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>If this were the contents of my kill ring and I pressed <kbd class="kbd">C-y</kbd>, the
string of characters saying &lsquo;<samp class="samp">some text</samp>&rsquo; would be inserted in this
buffer where my cursor is located.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">yank</code> command is also used for duplicating text by copying it.
The copied text is not cut from the buffer, but a copy of it is put on the
kill ring and is inserted by yanking it back.
</p>
<p>Three functions are used for bringing text back from the kill ring:
<code class="code">yank</code>, which is usually bound to <kbd class="kbd">C-y</kbd>; <code class="code">yank-pop</code>,
which is usually bound to <kbd class="kbd">M-y</kbd>; and <code class="code">rotate-yank-pointer</code>,
which is used by the two other functions.
</p>
<p>These functions refer to the kill ring through a variable called the
<code class="code">kill-ring-yank-pointer</code>.  Indeed, the insertion code for both the
<code class="code">yank</code> and <code class="code">yank-pop</code> functions is:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(insert (car kill-ring-yank-pointer))
</pre></div>

<p>(Well, no more.  In GNU Emacs 22, the function has been replaced by
<code class="code">insert-for-yank</code> which calls <code class="code">insert-for-yank-1</code>
repetitively for each <code class="code">yank-handler</code> segment.  In turn,
<code class="code">insert-for-yank-1</code> strips text properties from the inserted text
according to <code class="code">yank-excluded-properties</code>.  Otherwise, it is just
like <code class="code">insert</code>.  We will stick with plain <code class="code">insert</code> since it
is easier to understand.)
</p>
<p>To begin to understand how <code class="code">yank</code> and <code class="code">yank-pop</code> work, it is
first necessary to look at the <code class="code">kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> variable.
