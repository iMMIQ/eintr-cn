<p>When you install a function definition by evaluating it, it will stay
installed until you quit Emacs.  The next time you start a new session
of Emacs, the function will not be installed unless you evaluate the
function definition again.
</p>
<p>At some point, you may want to have code installed automatically
whenever you start a new session of Emacs.  There are several ways of
doing this:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>If you have code that is just for yourself, you can put the code for the
function definition in your <samp class="file">.emacs</samp> initialization file.  When you
start Emacs, your <samp class="file">.emacs</samp> file is automatically evaluated and all
the function definitions within it are installed.
See <a class="xref" href="Emacs-Initialization.html">Your <samp class="file">.emacs</samp> File</a>.

</li><li>Alternatively, you can put the function definitions that you want
installed in one or more files of their own and use the <code class="code">load</code>
function to cause Emacs to evaluate and thereby install each of the
functions in the files.
See <a class="xref" href="Loading-Files.html">Loading Files</a>.

</li><li>Thirdly, if you have code that your whole site will use, it is usual
to put it in a file called <samp class="file">site-init.el</samp> that is loaded when
Emacs is built.  This makes the code available to everyone who uses
your machine.  (See the <samp class="file">INSTALL</samp> file that is part of the Emacs
distribution.)
</li></ul>

<p>Finally, if you have code that everyone who uses Emacs may want, you
can post it on a computer network or send a copy to the Free Software
Foundation.  (When you do this, please license the code and its
documentation under a license that permits other people to run, copy,
study, modify, and redistribute the code and which protects you from
having your work taken from you.)  If you send a copy of your code to
the Free Software Foundation, and properly protect yourself and
others, it may be included in the next release of Emacs.  In large
part, this is how Emacs has grown over the past years, by donations.
