<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Symbol-names"></a>

<p>We can articulate another characteristic of Lisp based on what we have
discussed so far&mdash;an important characteristic: a symbol, like
<code class="code">+</code>, is not itself the set of instructions for the computer to
carry out.  Instead, the symbol is used, perhaps temporarily, as a way
of locating the definition or set of instructions.  What we see is the
name through which the instructions can be found.  Names of people
work the same way.  I can be referred to as &lsquo;<samp class="samp">Bob</samp>&rsquo;; however, I am
not the letters &lsquo;<samp class="samp">B</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">o</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">b</samp>&rsquo; but am, or was, the
consciousness consistently associated with a particular life-form.
The name is not me, but it can be used to refer to me.
</p>
<p>In Lisp, one set of instructions can be attached to several names.
For example, the computer instructions for adding numbers can be
linked to the symbol <code class="code">plus</code> as well as to the symbol <code class="code">+</code>
(and are in some dialects of Lisp).  Among humans, I can be referred
to as &lsquo;<samp class="samp">Robert</samp>&rsquo; as well as &lsquo;<samp class="samp">Bob</samp>&rsquo; and by other words as well.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, a symbol can have only one function definition
attached to it at a time.  Otherwise, the computer would be confused as
to which definition to use.  If this were the case among people, only
one person in the world could be named &lsquo;<samp class="samp">Bob</samp>&rsquo;.  However, the function
definition to which the name refers can be changed readily.
(See <a class="xref" href="Install.html">Install a Function Definition</a>.)
</p>
<p>Since Emacs Lisp is large, it is customary to name symbols in a way
that identifies the part of Emacs to which the function belongs.
Thus, all the names for functions that deal with Texinfo start with
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">texinfo-</samp>&rsquo; and those for functions that deal with reading mail
start with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">rmail-</samp>&rsquo;.
